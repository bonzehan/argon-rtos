Argon RTOS Todo List
====================

- Refactor list management code.
- Add constructors and copy constructors.
- Get global object lists working.
- Implement timers.
- Implement priority inheritence for mutexes.
- Finish user interrupt support.
- Clean up member function support for threads.
- Either implement or remove Thread::join().
- More thorough testing using cppunit.
- Unpriveledged support on M4?
- Event flags?
- Invert thread priorities, so that 0 is highest priority? This is the more common arrangement for RTOSes.
- Floating point support for M4F.
- Use circular linked lists instead of NULL terminated.
- Use a lock on the scheduler instead of disabling interrupts.
- Handle a thread changings its own priority when it owns a mutex and has been hoisted in priority.
- Check the IPSR to determine whether it is in an IRQ, so the irq depth doesn't have to be manually adjusted.
- Sort thread sleeping list by wakeup time.
- Add link from thread to object it's blocked on.
- Make scheduler smart enough to do round robin using beginning of ready list since that list is sorted by priority. i.e., it doesn't need to scan the entire list.
- Support tickless idle.
