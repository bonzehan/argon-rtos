{"name":"Argon RTOS","tagline":"Small embedded C++ RTOS","body":"Argon RTOS\r\n==========\r\n\r\nSmall embedded RTOS written almost entirely in C++.\r\n\r\n*Version*: 1.0a2<br/>\r\n*Status*: Actively under development. Not all features are fully implemented. The API is likely to change some more.\r\n\r\nSupported cores:\r\n\r\n- ARM Cortex-M0+\r\n- ARM Cortex-M4\r\n- ARM Cortex-M4F\r\n\r\nSupported toolchains:\r\n\r\n- IAR EWARM\r\n- Keil MDK (armcc)\r\n- GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors (gcc)\r\n\r\n### Overview\r\n\r\nArgon is designed to be a very clean RTOS kernel with a C++ API. Currently it also has a C API upon which the C++ API is built, but that may go away. The code is exceptionally readable and maintainable, and is well commented.\r\n\r\nThe resources provided by Argon are those most important for building a threaded application:\r\n\r\n- Thread\r\n- Semaphore\r\n- Mutex\r\n- Channel\r\n- Queue\r\n- Timer\r\n\r\nA memory allocator is not provided, as every Standard C Library includes malloc.\r\n\r\nDynamic memory is not required under any circumstance. All kernel objects can be allocated statically. This lets you determine application memory requirements at link time. However, you can still use `new` or `malloc()` to allocate objects if you prefer.\r\n\r\nThere are no limits on the number of kernel objects. You may create as many threads, channels, etc., as you like at runtime via dynamic allocation.\r\n\r\nArgon is primarily targeted at ARM Cortex-M processors, though it should be fairly easily portable to other architectures. The kernel itself is core agnostic. All core-specific code is isolated into a separate directory. The Cortex-M port only accesses common Cortex-M resources (i.e., SysTick, NVIC, and SCB), so it should work on any other Cortex-M platform.\r\n\r\n### Memory requirements\r\n\r\nTotal code size with all features enabled is approximately 4 kB. Kernel objects are not explicitly disable-able, but the linker will exclude any unused code.\r\n\r\nRAM requirements are quite small. The kernel itself consumes 128 bytes plus the idle thread stack. Timers share the idle thread stack, so you don't need an extra stack to use timers.\r\n\r\nKernel object sizes:\r\n\r\n- Thread = 92 bytes + stack\r\n- Channel = 36 bytes\r\n- Semaphore = 32 bytes\r\n- Mutex = 44 bytes\r\n- Queue = 60 bytes + element storage\r\n- Timer = 60 bytes\r\n\r\nThese sizes are as of 21 Dec 2014, and will probably change in the future. All above sizes were obtained using IAR EWARM 7.30 with full optimization enabled.\r\n\r\n### Supported chips and boards\r\n\r\nThese are the devices that have demo projects included in the repository. The kernel itself will build for any Cortex-M device.\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr><th>Family</th><th>Part Number</th><th>Board</th></tr>\r\n<tr><td>Freescale Kinetis</td><td>KL25Z128xxx4</td><td>FRDM-KL25Z</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td>KL43Z256xxx4</td><td>FRDM-KL43Z</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td>K20DX128xxx5</td><td>FRDM-K20D50M</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td>K22FN512xxx12</td><td>FRDM-K22F</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td>K60DZ128xxx10</td><td>TWR-K60N512</td></tr>\r\n<tr><td></td><td>K64F1M0xxx12</td><td>FRDM-K64F</td></tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Source code\r\n\r\nThe code for the Argon kernel is in the `src/argon` directory in the repository.\r\n\r\nThe [mbed](http://mbed.org) libraries are included under `src/mbed`, to provide a simple C++ driver API for demo applications. mbed device HALs are located in `src/mbed/targets`.\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nThe Argon RTOS is open source software released with a BSD three-clause license.
