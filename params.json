The kernel itself is core agnostic. All core-specific code is isolated into a separate directory. The Cortex-M port only accesses common Cortex-M resources (i.e., SysTick, NVIC, and SCB), so it should work on any other Cortex-M platform.\r\n\r\nThe resources provided by Argon are those most important for building a threaded application:\r\n\r\n- Thread\r\n- Semaphore\r\n- Mutex\r\n- Channel\r\n- Queue\r\n- Timer\r\n\r\n### Licensing\r\n\r\nThe Argon RTOS is released with a BSD three-clause license.
